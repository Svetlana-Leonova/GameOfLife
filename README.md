# Conway's Game Of Life

## Overview

The Game of Life is a cellular automaton that was invented by a Cambridge mathematician John Conway in 1970.
It consists of a collection of cells which, based on a few mathematical rules, can live, die or multiply.
Depending on the initial conditions, the cells form various patterns throughout the course of the game/simulation.

This weekend project was inspired by a leetcode problem of the same name.

It is a React implementation of the game of life algorithm.

I followed the below tutorial from FreeCodeCamp for React implementation and refactored the code from tutorial to use a different algorithm for running the simulation.
